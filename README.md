# END-TO-END-FAKE-NEWS-DETECTION
This project is a Fake News Detection System built using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP). It uses TF-IDF for feature extraction, sentiment analysis, and Named Entity Recognition (NER) for deeper insights. A Flask-based web app provides an interactive interface, achieving 95% accuracy.

Sentiment Analysis (Positive / Negative / Neutral)
Named Entity Recognition (NER) (People, Organizations, Locations, Dates, etc.)
Confidence Score for predictions
A user-friendly Flask Web App interface

STEP-1:
Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Fake-News-Detection.git
cd Fake-News-Detection

STEP-2:
Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
(requirements.txt should include: Flask, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, spacy, joblib)

STEP-3:
Run the Flask App
python main.py
Then, open your browser and go to ðŸ‘‰ http://127.0.0.1:5000/

STEP-4:
Train/Test the Model (Optional)
Open Testing.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook to:
Explore the dataset (merged_news.xlsx)
Retrain the model using TF-IDF + ML Classifier
Evaluate performance (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)


Features:
TF-IDF Feature Extraction â†’ Converts text into numerical features
ML Classifier (Logistic Regression) â†’ Predicts Fake / Real news
Sentiment Analysis â†’ Detects emotional tone
Named Entity Recognition (NER) â†’ Extracts people, places, and organizations
Confidence Score â†’ Gives probability of prediction
Interactive Web App â†’ Easy-to-use interface built with Flask + Bootstrap.
